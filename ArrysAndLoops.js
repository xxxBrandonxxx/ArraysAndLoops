//Below you shall find a tasks array which we will use for the rest of this challenge
//One line below this is the tasksCompleted array that we are going to use further use

//Activity 1 - Edit the tasksCompleted array by programmatically doing the following:
/*  1) Remove the first completed task
    2) Add a new completed task of false at beginning of the array
    3) Add a new completed task of true at the end of the array
    4) Add two more completed tasks with a boolean value of your choice, to the end of the array
*/
//Add your code below

// 1)
console.log(tasksCompleted)

//2)

tasksCompleted.shift()
console.log(tasksCompleted)


//3)

tasksCompleted.push(true)
console.log(tasksCompleted)

//4)
tasksCompleted.push(true , false)
console.log(tasksCompleted)


//Activity 2 - Complete this function. 
//Create a for loop that can loop through an array and print out all the array items in the console.
//This function takes a parameter of arrayName.
    function displayArray(arrayName){
    //Add your code below



    }
    
//Activity 3 - Print the tasks array to the console by using the function you created in Activity 2
//Add your code below



//Activity 4 - Complete this function.
//The purpose of this function is to calculate the sum of all the values in an array.
//Create a variable inside this function called total and set it equal to 0.
//Create a for loop that calculates the sum of all the values in an array store the answer in the total variable.
//Outside the for loop, console log the total.
    function calculateTotal(arrayName){
    //Add your code below



    }

//Activity 5 - Call the calculateTotal function and pass tasksCompleted as an argument.
//Add your code below




//Activity 6 - Complete this function
//The purpose of this function is to calculate the average of the values put together in an array
//Create a variable inside this function called total and set it equal to 0
//Create a for loop that calculates the sum of all the values in an array, store the answer in the total variable
//Outside the for loop, create a variable called average and store your calculations of the average in that variable
//Add your code below


//Activity 7 - Call your calculate average function with tasksCompleted array as it's argument
//Add your code below


//Bonus Activity:
//Rewrite activity 6 to calculate the average of the amount of tasksCompleted that is equal to true
//Add your code below

//Create a function that takes two array parameters, the second parameter being a rest parameter
//Within your function block, specify a condition to prevent your function from having more than a 3 argument values
//Within the arguments condition, loop through the array arguments provided and concole.log each value
//Console.log your argument length an your function
//Refer to the Arguments method taught in the 3rd lesson
//Add your code below
